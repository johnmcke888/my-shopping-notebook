This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
# Technical Evolution Log

## Project Vision & Goals
My Shopping Notebook (MSN) is designed to be a comprehensive shopping optimization platform that helps users maximize value across their entire shopping lifecycle. The core concept is to create a unified dashboard where users can:

1. **Purchase Planning & Optimization**
   - Track planned purchases and their target prices
   - Set price alerts and deal notifications
   - Compare prices across different retailers
   - Calculate optimal timing for purchases based on:
     - Historical price data
     - Known sale patterns
     - Available rewards/credits
     - Shopping portal bonuses

2. **Value Maximization Tools**
   - Track and optimize credit card rewards
   - Monitor shopping portal rewards/cashback
   - Manage store-specific rewards programs
   - Track gift cards and store credits
   - Calculate stacking opportunities (e.g., portal + credit card + store rewards)

3. **Deal Calendar & Alerts**
   - Track upcoming sales and promotions
   - Monitor price history
   - Set alerts for price drops
   - Predict optimal purchase timing

4. **Purchase History & Analytics**
   - Track actual purchases
   - Compare actual vs target prices
   - Calculate lifetime savings
   - Generate spending insights
   - Track value obtained from various reward programs

The platform aims to solve several key problems:
- Fragmented tracking of various rewards programs
- Missed opportunities for reward stacking
- Suboptimal purchase timing
- Forgotten gift cards and credits
- Missed price drops
- Inefficient use of shopping portals

Target user experience should:
- Present complex value calculations in an intuitive way
- Automate reward stacking suggestions
- Provide clear next actions for maximizing value
- Maintain a clean, professional interface despite complex underlying calculations
- Make advanced shopping optimization accessible to average users

## Core Technical Decisions & Evolution

### Authentication Implementation
- Initially implemented with Clerk using server-side `auth()`
- Migrated to client-side `useAuth()` after discovering server/client component conflict
- Solution involved proper 'use client' directive placement and component restructuring
- Key Learning: Authentication checks must be handled differently in server vs client components

### Component Architecture
1. Initial Structure
   - Root layout with ClerkProvider
   - Protected routes under (protected) directory
   - Public routes under (auth) directory
   - Catch-all routes for sign-in/sign-up

2. Dashboard Evolution
   - Started with basic layout
   - Expanded to 8-section tabbed interface
   - Implemented grid-based card layout for metrics
   - Uses Lucide icons for consistent visual language

### UI Component Strategy
- Initially attempted shadcn/ui integration
- Encountered installation/import issues
- Created custom card components in src/components/ui/
- Now successfully using shadcn (renamed from shadcn-ui) components
- Core components: Card, Tabs, UserButton

### State Management
- Using React hooks for local state
- Clerk hooks (useAuth, useUser) for authentication state
- Considering Prisma + PostgreSQL for data persistence

### Known Issues & Solutions
1. Authentication Flow
   - Issue: Redirect loop after sign-in
   - Solution: Proper middleware configuration with publicRoutes
   - Learning: Middleware needs careful route matcher configuration

2. Component Imports
   - Issue: shadcn component import failures
   - Solution: Manual component implementation + proper shadcn setup
   - Current Status: Using shadcn components with correct import paths

3. Client/Server Components
   - Issue: Auth hooks failing in server components
   - Solution: Proper 'use client' directives
   - Pattern: Auth logic in client components, data fetching in server components

## Feature Implementation Status

### Gift Card System
- Implemented card type detection (network vs store cards)
- Smart validation based on card type:
  - Luhn algorithm for network card numbers
  - Proper CVV/PIN length validation
  - Optional validation throughout for user flexibility
- Comprehensive date handling:
  - Expiration tracking for both MM/YYYY and full date formats
  - Next expiration tracking in dashboard
  - Historical date tracking (added/spent dates)
- State management:
  - Active vs spent card filtering
  - In-place editing capabilities
  - Optimistic updates for user actions
- Security features:
  - Masked card numbers
  - Optional PIN/CVV storage
  - Save confirmations
- Status: Production-ready v1.0

### Dashboard
- Grid-based metric cards
- Real-time data display
- Responsive layout
- Status: Core structure complete, needs real data integration

## Technical Debt & Considerations
1. Database Layer
   - Prisma schema defined but not implemented
   - Need to implement database synchronization
   - Consider migration strategy

2. Performance
   - Client/server component balance
   - Data fetching strategy needed
   - Consider implementing React Query

3. Security
   - Protected routes implemented
   - Need to implement CSRF protection
   - Consider rate limiting for API routes

## Next Steps
1. Database Implementation
   - Finalize Prisma schema
   - Implement database synchronization
   - Add migration scripts

2. Feature Completion
   - Portal tracking system
   - Deal calendar
   - Purchase planner
   - Rewards tracking

3. Infrastructure
   - Set up proper error boundaries
   - Implement logging
   - Add testing framework

## Critical Context for Future Development
- Authentication must use client-side components
- shadcn components available and properly configured
- Card components established pattern for metrics display
- Database layer pending but schema defined
